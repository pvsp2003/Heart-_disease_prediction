# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

A Django-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a **Random Forest** model. Users input health-related data, and the app generates a **personalized PDF report** containing the prediction result, model confidence, and feature importance visualization using **SHAP**. The report is automatically emailed to the user.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧑‍🧬 **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest classifier trained on structured health data.
* 🌐 **Django Web Interface**: Clean and interactive form-based UI for user input.
* 📊 **SHAP Explainability**: Visualizes per-instance feature contributions via a pie chart.
* 📄 **PDF Report Generation**: Auto-generates a professional report with:

  * User's input data
  * Prediction outcome
  * Confidence score
  * SHAP-based feature importance chart
* 📧 **Email Integration**: Sends the report directly to the user's email.

## 🧲 Example Prediction Workflow

1. User fills in the form with medical data.
2. ML model predicts risk (e.g., "High Risk of Heart Disease").
3. SHAP computes feature contribution.
4. A PDF report is created and emailed to the user.
